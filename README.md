# Park Tree Map

A simple, self-hosted map of the trees in your park, for "Friends of" groups
and other volunteer organisations to catalogue and share.

- **Data** lives in a Google Sheet you control.
- **The map** is a single web page hosted free of charge on GitHub Pages.
- **Photos** can be uploaded straight from your phone — they're stored in
  your GitHub repository.
- **No coding** required. No terminal. Five steps and you're live.

**Live example:** [Bayonne Park, London W6](https://bayonne-park.parktreemap.org/)

## What you'll need

- A **Google account** (for the spreadsheet and the Apps Script).
- A **GitHub account** (free — for the website and photo storage).
- About **30 minutes** for the first-time setup.

## Five steps to your own map

Each step has its own page with screenshots and exact clicks. Follow them in
order:

1. **[Set up your Google Sheet](docs/01-setup-google-sheet.md)** — make a
   copy of the template, publish it, and copy the Sheet ID.
2. **[Fork the GitHub repository](docs/02-fork-github-repo.md)** — fork this
   project and turn on GitHub Pages.
3. **[Create the Apps Script](docs/03-apps-script.md)** — paste a small
   script, set three secrets, and copy the deployment URL.
4. **[Configure the app](docs/04-configure-app.md)** — edit `config.js`
   with your park name, Sheet ID, and Apps Script URL.
5. **[Add your first tree](docs/07-add-trees.md)** — open your live map and
   tap the *Add a tree* button.

That's it. Your map is live.
